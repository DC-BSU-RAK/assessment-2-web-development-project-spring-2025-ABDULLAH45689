                    <p class="excerpt">A worthy sequel that improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way, despite some technical issuesThis was my favorite video game of 2023. It's well paced, well written, and pretty well done. It's one of my favorite additions to Star Wars and it levels up its predecessor (Jedi: Fallen Order) in ever way.

Gameplay:
The combat has been improved for the better. Lot's of combat in the story and even more during exploration. You can easily change the difficulty at anytime throughout the game baed on the experience that you want. There are new force abilities and new lightsaber tricks that truly reflect how Cal has improved between the two games. Only issue you may find with combat is the camera, especially in closed spaces. 

The narrative is a worthy continuation of Cal's story and it's got perfect moment throughout the story that constantly keep you interested in the game. 

The exploration has definitely been improved from Fallen Order, with a big new world (Koboh) that has plenty to offer the player in exploration. There are other worlds to explore as well including the well known Capital of the Galactic Empire, Coruscant. Lots of chests to open which give you plenty of items for customization.

Customization has definitely improved from Fallen Order. You can customize every element of Cal's lightsaber and have plenty of things to choose from (if you find all the chests, that is). You can also customize BD-1 with more detail and color and you can customize almost everything about Cal, from his hair down to his shoes.

I just wanted to throw this in here because I am a big fan of music in film and video games, but THE SCORE! This game has some of the best music I've ever heard, especially in Star Wars. I have to point out that Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab won a Grammy for their work on this game and it was so well deserved. 

I give it five stars. I had one of the best video gaming experiences I ever had playing this thing and it's my favorite story from a Star Wars spinoff. I'm so excited for the next Jedi game....</p>
